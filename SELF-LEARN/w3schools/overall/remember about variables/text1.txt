1. There 2 main type of varables: → use `type(<variable>)` to know 
    - STRINGS: 
        + prioritize `‘ ’`, then `“ ”` ,  these can combine many variables
            code 
        + can loop through a long string by 
            using "for" loop 
                code 
            use indexes ↔ can customize the range 
                code
            also use "for" loop to check if a word/character in the string 
                code

    use `f`  before the string and `{}` in the string for it to be multifunction → cleaner code syntax, more function in 1 line of string 
        inside the placeholders can be anything: variables, function (format type, math, if else statement,..)
        but USE different symbol 

    - NUMBERS: use `random([range])` to generate a random line of numbers: `random(1, 10)`
            use operators to execute function: Arithmetic, Assignment, Comparison, Logical 
    
2. Syntax style (naming): *snake* style `variable_1 = 6`
3. There are 2 kind of variable scope (the region it can be used): 
    - LOCAL variables: means inside a function → can ONLY be executed INSIDE that function ⇒ use `global` keyword before the name to use it globally
    - GLOBAL variables: outside functions → DEFAULT VALUE for all the function that don’t have a specified value for it
